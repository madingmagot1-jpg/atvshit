    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <h3>From ‚Äì$8,247 to +$127,893 in 16 Months</h3>
    <p>Here's exactly how I went from a losing bettor to consistently profitable‚Äîand how you can do the same.</p>
    <h4>Rock Bottom: ‚Äì$8,247</h4>
    <p>12 months of bleeding money ‚Ä¶ I was like most bettors. I'd bet on my favorite teams‚Ä¶ convince myself I had an edge because I watched every game. Spoiler: I didn‚Äôt have an edge.</p>
    <h4>The Lightbulb Moment</h4>
    <p>Everything changed when I learned this: +EV betting (positive expected value). Turns out, sharp bettors don't bet on who they think will win. They bet when the odds are mathematically in their favor.</p>
    <p>If a team has a 55% chance to win, but you're getting odds that imply only 50%? That's +EV. Do that hundreds of times, and the math guarantees profit.</p>
    <p>I spent 3 months learning everything: expected value, arbitrage, closing line value, bankroll management, Kelly Criterion. I built spreadsheets. I tracked every single bet.</p>

    <h3>The Results Speak</h3>
    <p>The math actually works. The difference was night and day. I went from losing every month to winning consistently. Not every day ‚Äî I still have red days. But over hundreds of bets, the positive expected value compounds.</p>
    <p><strong>+ $127,893</strong> Total profit over 16 months (every bet tracked). But here's the problem: finding +EV bets manually takes HOURS.</p>

    <h3>So I Built This</h3>
    <p>You need to compare odds across 15+ sportsbooks. Calculate expected value. Identify arbitrage opportunities. Move fast before lines change. I‚Äôve been doing this manually for months. It works, but it's exhausting. So I built a tool that does it automatically.</p>
    <p>Real-time Discord alerts the second a +EV bet or arbitrage opportunity appears. No more manual scanning. No more missed opportunities.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What exactly is +EV betting?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>+EV (positive expected value) betting means betting when the odds are mathematically in your favor. For example, if a team has a 55% chance to win but the odds imply only 50%, that's +EV. Over hundreds of bets, this edge compounds into consistent profit. It's not gambling ‚Äî it's math.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How do the Discord alerts work?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Our system scans 15+ sportsbooks 24/7. When it identifies a +EV bet or arbitrage opportunity, you get an instant Discord notification (usually within 90 seconds). The alert includes: sport, game, bet type, recommended sportsbook, odds, and calculated EV or guaranteed profit percentage.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What‚Äôs the difference between +EV betting and arbitrage?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>+EV betting: You bet when odds are favorable. There's still variance (you can lose individual bets), but the math ensures long-term profit. Arbitrage: You bet both sides of a game on different sportsbooks to guarantee profit regardless of outcome. Zero risk, but less common.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How much bankroll do I need to start?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>You can start with as little as $500‚Äì$1,000, but we recommend $2,000‚Äì$5,000 for optimal bankroll management. The more capital you have, the smoother your variance and faster you can scale. Our education includes full bankroll management and Kelly Criterion guidance.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Which sportsbooks do I need accounts with?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <div class="answer">
          <p>We recommend having accounts at: DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars, BetRivers, PointsBet, and as many others as legally available in your state. The more books you have access to, the more +EV opportunities you can capture. We‚Äôll guide you through the setup process.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is this legal?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes, 100% legal. We‚Äôre simply identifying when odds are favorable across legal, regulated sportsbooks. +EV betting and arbitrage are legitimate strategies used by professional bettors. You must be 21+ and betting must be legal in your state.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I really guarantee profit with this?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>No one can guarantee profit in betting. However, with +EV betting, you have a mathematical edge that ensures long-term profitability over hundreds of bets (assuming proper bankroll management and discipline). Arbitrage opportunities guarantee profit on individual bets, but they're less frequent. Our results show what‚Äôs realistic. Users must be aware of variance and risk.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What if I get limited by sportsbooks?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Getting limited is a real risk for successful bettors. Our education includes strategies to avoid getting limited quickly, but it's inevitable if you're consistently winning. The good news: by the time you're limited, you've likely already made significant profit. We'll teach you how to maximize your window.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How much time does this require?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>That‚Äôs up to you. Some members check alerts once or twice a day and place 2‚Äì5 bets (15‚Äì30 minutes). Others more active place 10‚Äì20 bets daily (1‚Äì2 hours). More bets = more profit, but even casual participation can be profitable. The alerts do the heavy lifting ‚Äî you just execute.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What‚Äôs included in the $30/month?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Everything: real-time Discord alerts for +EV and arbitrage, education library, full performance tracking, 24/7 community access, personal consultations, and ongoing strategy updates. No hidden fees. Founder pricing locks in $30/month forever.</p>
